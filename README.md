Demo Application I am using for SkillShare teachings.

* Download Java 8 from <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html#JDK8>
* Once downloaded and installed, make sure Java is added to your `PATH`.  It is wise to set the `JAVA_HOME` variable and use that for the `PATH`.  The `CLASSPATH` setting on your machine should reflect the following for Windows `.;%JAVA_HOME%\lib` or `.:$JAVA_HOME/lib` on non-Windows operating systems
* Download Apache Maven from <http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>.  Extract it to your location of choice and add the `MAVEN_HOME` variable to your environment.  Add `MAVEN_HOME\bin` to your `PATH` on Windows or `$MAVEN_HOME/bin` for other operating systems
* Download your choice of IDE.  This project will work fine with:
  * Intellij IDEA - download from <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>.  Make sure you choose your OS.  You can choose between the commercial or community edition 
  * Spring Tool Suite (STS) - download from <https://spring.io/tools/sts/all>
  * Eclipse - download from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/>.  I would strongly recommend choosing the 'Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers' versions for your given operating system
* You would also require Git installed on your machine.  Have a look here for details <https://git-scm.com/>.
